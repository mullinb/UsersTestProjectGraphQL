# UsersTestProjectGraphQL
Basic introduction to GraphQL and GraphiQL via Stephen Grider at Udemy.

The most important code in this repository is that found within the schema file. It is a simple copy of Stephen's demonstration, but was my introduction to GraphQL schemas. In the tutorial, Stephen also teaches how to use GraphiQL in the browser to navigate and retrieve info from an existing data structure (here, db.json).
